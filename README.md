libzm-plugin-openalpr
=====================

## Overview

libzm-plugin-openalpr is a free, open source Licence Plate Recognition plugin for the ZoneMinder CCTV sofware (https://github.com/ZoneMinder/ZoneMinder).
It is based on openalpr library (https://github.com/openalpr/openalpr).
The recognized license plates are added to the event notes.

## Requirements

libzm-plugin-openalpr requires a working plugin framework in ZoneMinder.
Currently the plugin framework is not supported in upstream ZoneMinder but it can be built from this repository https://github.com/manupap1/ZoneMinder

If you are installing ZoneMinder from a package, that package should provide all of the needed core components.
